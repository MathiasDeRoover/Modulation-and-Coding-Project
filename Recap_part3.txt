

CFO max carrier freq/ppm
SCO max sample clock freq/ppm
FPE 0--> 2pi
sampling time shift 0--> symbol duration


Gardner: Get rid of wrong sampling(CSO+sampling time shift)
Frame estimation: Detect where pilots begin and estimate CFO
	--> CFO can be compensated in next data (enough to get rid of ISI)
--> Still linear varying phase over time
	--> Estimate by linearly estimating phase between 2 pilots
