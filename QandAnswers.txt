To do:

Odd number of filter taps so we can drop the same amount at start and end.

Use tips from slide 19 to differentiate between pam, qam, bpsk (= 2 bit pam)

Do you mean where this is implemented in code or how in general we would implement it? Optimisation in theory? → Yes

Higher beta means, higher attenuation of the sidelobes in the time domain. If the sidelobes decay faster you will need fewer filter taps to rep
