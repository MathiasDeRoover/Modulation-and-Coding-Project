Q&A2:
(Initial) value for sigma in soft decoding related to chain ( variance of output noise at demod)
	How to determine sigma?

Is our reasoning for the questions correct?

Is it possible that hard_decoding yields higher BER for QAM?

Iteration limit has no influence on code gain?

Is it normal that the logarithmic soft decoder takes much longer to run?
